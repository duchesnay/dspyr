    "\n",

Numbers can be integers or real numbers and they are used to represent values observed for a continuous or discrete statistical variable, while strings are everything else that cannot be represented as numbers or list of numbers, e.g. address of a building, answer to an open-ended question in a survey, etc.\n",
