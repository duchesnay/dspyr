    "\n",
    "In the spirit of the *Grammar of Graphics* developped by Leland Wilkinson, the `ggplot2` library uses a system of layers where graphical elements are joined altogether in a coherent way.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](assets/lang-r-ggplot-001.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following elements are usually found, in more or less the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ggplot()`: a data frame (`data=`) together with a mapping (`aes()`)\n",
    "- `geom_*()`: one or more geometrical objects\n",
    "- `facet_wrap()`: a system of facets (used for conditioning on additional variables)\n",
    "- `scale_*_*()`: a custom scale for each axis and color schemes\n",
    "- `coord_*()`: a coordinate system\n",
    "- `labs()`: some annotations for axes and other graphical properties\n",
    "- `theme_*()`: a custom theme\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, we start by indicating the data frame in which the variables can be found (`data =`), and what role these variables play in the plot (`aes(x=, y=, color=)`). Two numerical variables can be used to code the spatial location of a point in a 2D space, while a categorical variable could be used to highligtht those points using color values mapped onto variable levels. The type of graphical object we wan to draw (`geom_point()`, `geom_histogram()`) depends on the number and the type of variables available in the `aes()` mapping. If there's only one numeric variable, we cannot draw a scatterplot, of course, but we can build an histogram, for example. Note that a single plot can contain multiple geometrical object, e.g. a scatterplot and a scatterplot smoother (lowess curve). Each plot can be customized in several ways, but most of the time we may be interested in updating the axes or the object properties (e.g., `scale_x_continuous()`, `scale_color_manual()`), and the labels or the title/subtitle (`labs()`).\n",

This is controlled in the `aes`thetic directly.
